This Privacy Policy describes how "FabLogic" ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our website (https://bearded1derer.github.io/) and any related services, software, or applications (collectively, the "Service").

By accessing or using the Service, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Service includes:

### Personal Data

Personally identifiable information, such as your name, shipping address, email address, and telephone number, and demographic information, such as your age, gender, hometown, and interests, that you voluntarily give to us when you register with the Service or when you choose to participate in various activities related to the Service.

### Derivative Data

Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Service, such as your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, your access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Service.

### Financial Data

Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g., valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date) that we may collect when you purchase, order, return, exchange, or request information about our services from the Service.

**Note:** We store very limited, if any, financial information that we collect. Otherwise, all financial information is stored by our payment processor, **Stripe**, and you are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions.

## 2. Use of Your Information

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Service to:

* Process payments and refunds.

* Email you regarding your account or order.

* Fulfill and manage purchases, orders, payments, and other transactions related to the Service.

* Generate a personal profile about you to make future visits to the Service more personalized.

* Increase the efficiency and operation of the Service.

* Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the Service.

* Prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft, and protect against criminal activity.

## 3. Disclosure of Your Information

We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:

### Third-Party Service Providers

We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.

### Stripe

We use Stripe for payment, analytics, and other business services. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at <https://stripe.com/privacy>.

### By Law or to Protect Rights

If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.

## 4. Security of Your Information

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

## 5. Policy for Children

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.

## 6. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
